### Our Goal?

As a team we wanted to create a functional web application that would allow for the sending and receiving of messages from multiple connected users. Our application supports light and dark mode for the chat window, the creation and storage of users with unique usernames and passwords, and a running log of logged in and active users alongside statistics that mirror what may be found in a larger, more robust application.

### What is the intended use of our application?

For those who download it, this application will serve as a direct route of communication for all connected individuals (who have also properly installed the program) who are running the application through the same port. Created for a final project for our Web Development class, it is simple, but functional and designed with the user in mind. Ease of use was a goal part of the creation process.
