### What is our goal?

We intended to design a web application that would allow numerous connected users to send and receive messages. Our application offers both light and dark chat window modes, the creation and storing of users with unique usernames and passwords, and a running log of signed in and active users, as well as statistics similar to those seen in a bigger, more robust application.

### What is the intended use of our application?

The app is designed to serve as a direct communication channel for any connected users who run the application on the same port. It is basic yet functional, and it was created with the user's convenience in mind.

## Special Instructions for Execution
